## 1. Overview

This document outlines the technical design for the AWS infrastructure deployed using AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit). The goal is to provide a scalable, secure, and maintainable cloud environment for the target application/workloads.

---

## 2. Objectives

- Automate provisioning of AWS resources via CDK
- Ensure repeatability and version control of infrastructure
- Enforce security best practices
- Enable easy modification and extensibility of infrastructure components

---

## 3. Architecture

### High-Level Diagram

```
[User] --> [API Gateway] --> [Lambda Functions] --> [DynamoDB]
                                   |
                               [VPC, Security Groups]
                                   |
                                 [S3]
```

_Replace with your actual architecture if different._

### Description

- The deployment is designed around a serverless architecture utilizing AWS managed services to minimize operational overhead and maximize scalability.

---

## 4. AWS Services Used

- **AWS CDK**: Infrastructure as Code tool for defining AWS resources in code.
- **Amazon S3**: Object storage for static files, artifacts, or backups.
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute for backend logic.
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: NoSQL database for scalable, low-latency data storage.
- **Amazon API Gateway**: Provides RESTful endpoints for client applications.
- **Amazon VPC**: Provides network isolation and security.
- **IAM**: Fine-grained access control for resources.
- **CloudWatch**: Logging and monitoring.
- _(Add/remove services as needed based on your deployment.)_

---

## 5. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Design

- **Language:** TypeScript/Python/JavaScript (specify based on your CDK implementation)
- **Project Structure:**  
    - `/lib`: CDK stack definitions
    - `/bin`: CDK entrypoint
    - `/cdk.json`: CDK configuration
    - `/test`: Automated tests for stacks
- **Resource Naming Conventions:**  
    - All resources are prefixed with the project name and environment (e.g., `myproj-dev-...`)
- **Environment Configurations:**  
    - Separate stacks for dev, staging, and prod environments
- **Parameters and Secrets:**  
    - Managed via AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store or AWS Secrets Manager

---

## 6. Deployment Process

1. **Bootstrap Environment:**  
   `cdk bootstrap`
2. **Synthesize CloudFormation Template:**  
   `cdk synth`
3. **Deploy Stacks:**  
   `cdk deploy`
4. **Rollback Strategy:**  
   Leveraging CloudFormation automatic rollback on failure
5. **CI/CD Integration:**  
   Optionally integrated with GitHub Actions for automated deployments

---

## 7. Security Considerations

- **IAM Roles and Policies:**  
  Principle of least privilege enforced for all Lambda, API Gateway, and CDK execution roles.
- **VPC Security:**  
  Only necessary ports open, use of security groups and NACLs.
- **Secrets Management:**  
  No hardcoded secrets; use of AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store.
- **Encryption:**  
  S3 buckets and DynamoDB tables encrypted at rest.

---

## 8. Monitoring & Logging

- **CloudWatch Logs:**  
  Enabled for Lambda and API Gateway.
- **Alarms:**  
  Configure CloudWatch alarms for error rates, latency, and resource utilization.
- **Dashboards:**  
  Optional: Custom CloudWatch dashboards for operational visibility.

---

## 9. Scalability & High Availability

- **Lambda Functions:**  
  Scales automatically based on invocation rate.
- **DynamoDB:**  
  Configured with on-demand or provisioned capacity as needed.
- **S3 & API Gateway:**  
  AWS managed, inherently scalable and highly available.
- **Multi-AZ Deployment:**  
  All resources that support it are deployed in multiple availability zones.

---

## 10. Cost Considerations

- **Pay-per-use Services:**  
  Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB (on-demand) minimize idle costs.
- **Resource Cleanup:**  
  Automated stack deletion for unused environments (dev/test).
- **Budget Alerts:**  
  Optional: AWS Budgets and cost alerts configured.

## 11. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                         | Mitigation                                   |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Misconfigured IAM policies   | Peer review and automated policy linting     |
| Resource drift               | Regular stack updates and drift detection    |
| Cost overruns                | Budget alerts, tagging, resource quotas      |
| Secrets leakage              | Enforced use of Secrets Manager/Parameter Store |

---

## 12. Future Enhancements

- Add automated integration and unit testing for CDK stacks
- Introduce blue/green deployment strategies
- Expand monitoring with third-party tools
- Implement canary releases and A/B testing
